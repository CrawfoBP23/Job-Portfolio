# Job-Portfolio
A collection of my past coding projects showcasing my software development skills, problem-solving abilities, and growth as a programmer. Includes work in various languages, frameworks, and concepts.

# SDE_Wordle
The point of this assignment was for me to practice writing effective tests and following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. By working on different parts of the Wordle program, I learned how to use JUnit 5 for both white-box and black-box testing, identify and fix bugs, and develop new features through careful testing and iteration. This assignment also helped me understand the importance of creating thorough, well-structured test plans and using Git branches to track my development process step by step.

# SDE_Apportionment
The point of this assignment was for me to get familiar with the concept of apportionment, which is a democratic process used to divide indivisible resources — like seats in the U.S. House of Representatives — based on state populations. By implementing Alexander Hamilton's apportionment algorithm, I got to practice my Java programming skills, collaborate with others using Git and GitHub, and learn how to build software iteratively while responding to changing requirements. This assignment also helped me get comfortable working in a team and using tools like Gradle.
